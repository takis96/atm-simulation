For the implementation of the atm simulation i used Laravel with PHP 8.2.0 and MySQL (MariaDB is also fine)
I decided on Laravel because it gave me the ability to create secure restful api calls for every action needed on the instructions and I could also easily check them with corresponding tests.
To run the project you will need to clone the project locally and install PHP 8.2.0,  Composer, MySQL and to create a database. After you make sure you have installed Composer(Laravel), PHP, MySQL(or MariaDB), name the database whatever you want and create a user granting all privileges. Update these fields in .env file with what you've created:
DB_DATABASE=
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
After that, you should open the app's route with command line and run the following: 
php artisan migrate (to migrate to the database the tables needed)
php artisan serve (to run the application)

To test the actions you requested you can use any suitable interface or POSTMAN
If you choose POSTMAN (I did also), run the following:

POST: http://localhost:8000/api/initialize with body in form-data key:note_value value:20 and key:quantity - value:(whatever you want) for the initialization. Run it a second time changing the note_value to 50 and quantinty again whatever you want for 50 valued notes.

GET: http://localhost:8000/api/available-notes it will return a json in this form 
{
    "notes": [
        {
            "note_value": 50,
            "quantity": 97
        },
        {
            "note_value": 20,
            "quantity": 97
        }
    ]
}

POST: http://localhost:8000/api/dispense-money with body in form-data key:amount - value:(anything you want to test) it will return a json 
{
    "error": "Unable to dispense this amount with available notes"
} 
or
{
    "message": "Money dispensed successfully"
}
depending on the amount you provide. You can also check that it works correclty by trying the previous get api again afterwards.

I have also implemented feature tests for every function implemented in the Controller. You'll find them at Tests/Feature. You can run the tests through command line also with: php artisan test
